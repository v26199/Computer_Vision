# Real-Time Hand Gesture Recognition using OpenCV & MediaPipe üçãü§ñ  

## Overview  
This project implements a **real-time hand gesture recognition system** using **Python, OpenCV, and MediaPipe**. It detects and classifies hand gestures such as:  
- Thumbs Up  
- Thumbs Down  
- Open Hand  
- Fist  
- Peace Sign  
- Rock Sign  
- OK Sign  

## Features  
- Real-time hand tracking using MediaPipe  
- Gesture classification based on hand landmarks  
- Works on a webcam feed with live detection  

## Tech Stack  
- Python  
- OpenCV  
- MediaPipe  

## Installation  
1. Clone this repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shetashreya/machine-learning.git
   cd machine-learning
   ```
2. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python mediapipe numpy
   ```
3. Run the script:  
   ```bash
   python gesture_recognition.py
   ```

## Future Improvements  
- Add more gestures  
- Train a deep learning model for better accuracy  
- Build a GUI version
